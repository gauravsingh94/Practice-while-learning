# Context and Recoil Practice Website

This project serves as a practice ground for learning and experimenting with "Context" and "Recoil" in React. The website features a simple counter application with two buttons, "Increase" and "Decrease," to modify the count value.

## Functionality

- Pressing the "Increase" button increments the count value.
- Pressing the "Decrease" button decrements the count value.

## Optimization

In the initial implementation, all components get re-rendered for every state update, which is not optimal for performance. However, please note that this project is designed as a small practice exercise, and it does not focus on extensive prop drilling prevention.

For more advanced prop drilling prevention techniques, please refer to the following projects:

- **[Recoil-part-2]**: In this project, we demonstrate how to prevent prop drilling by leveraging the Context library.Context provides a more efficient and scalable solution for state management in React applications.

- **Recoil-part-3**: This project explores techniques to minimize unnecessary re-renders using Recoil. By carefully managing state and atom dependencies, we can achieve a more optimized rendering behavior.

Feel free to explore these projects to deepen your understanding of React state management and performance optimization techniques using Context and Recoil.

## About

This website is a result of my learning journey in React, specifically focusing on state management using "Context" and "Recoil." It serves as a stepping stone towards more advanced projects and real-world applications. As I continue to grow as a developer, I will build upon these concepts and expand my knowledge in the realm of front-end development.

Thank you for checking out this project! If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to share them with me. Happy coding!
