# Recoil-part-2: Prop Drilling Prevention with Context

In this project, we showcase how to prevent prop drilling using React's Context . Context offers an efficient and straightforward way to manage state and data flow throughout your React application.

### Functionality

In this improved version, we leverage the Context to create a centralized state management system. The state is lifted to the top-level component, making it accessible to all child components without the need for prop drilling.

### Prop Drilling Prevention

By using Context, we avoid the need to pass state and functions down through multiple levels of components. Instead, we define a context provider at the top level, which makes the state and relevant functions available to any child component that needs them.

### Limitation of Context

While using Context helps prevent prop drilling, other components within the application may still re-render on state updates, especially when dealing with complex state dependencies.

### Enhanced Performance with Recoil

To address this limitation and achieve better performance, we can transition from using Context to Recoil. Recoil is a powerful state management library designed for React, offering a more fine-grained approach to managing state and minimizing unnecessary re-renders.

### Recoil-part-3

I have further improved the application's performance by using Recoil in the **recoil-part-3** project. In this project, we explore techniques to minimize unnecessary re-renders using Recoil by carefully managing state and atom dependencies.

Feel free to explore the Recoil-part-3 project to see how we enhance the application's efficiency and optimize rendering behavior using Recoil.
